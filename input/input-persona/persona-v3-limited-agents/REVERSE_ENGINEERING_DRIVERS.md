# Reverse-Engineering Drivers

## Purpose

Reverse-engineering drivers are oriented toward **documentation purposes**, focusing on **understanding** the system and enabling **potential future maintenance**. The primary goal is to create comprehensive documentation that captures the system's behavior, purpose, and usage context for stakeholders at the end-user, architect, and business levels.

## Scope and Constraints

The reverse-engineering process **MUST reflect with the highest fidelity** the actual simulation code, at the **simulation-level** (not at the end-user level). The primary audience is **developers** and, potentially, **architects**.

**Do not provide information** about how the system was designed or implemented at a higher abstraction level. The reverse-engineering process should focus on documenting the simulation code's actual behavior:

- **What** the simulation code does (functional behavior at simulation-level)
- **How** the simulation behaves (simulation mechanics and logic)
- **Who** uses it (stakeholders and use cases relevant to the simulation)

This documentation-oriented approach ensures that the reverse-engineered artifacts serve as a high-fidelity reference for understanding the actual simulation code and support future maintenance activities by developers and architects.

## Stakeholder Identification

Identify the **target stakeholders** of the Use-Case Instance. These stakeholders are essential for:

- **Illustrating** the system's purpose and behavior in the documentation
- **Validating** the reverse-engineered model against real-world usage scenarios
- **Understanding** the simulation's role in the broader context

The stakeholders represent the primary users and beneficiaries of the system, providing the necessary context to ensure the reverse-engineered documentation accurately reflects the system's intended behavior and business value, thereby facilitating future comprehension and maintenance efforts.
